## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

### What I learned

For this solution I reaffirmed my abilities of HTML y CSS.
For first time I used the methodology BEM, to write a CSS.
With the nomenclature I could  have a CSS file easily to read, understand and scalable. In addition, BEM helps to organize CSS classes in independent modules.
In this case, even though this is a short exercise, is useful to avoid CSS nest.

I take this solution to put in

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card">
        <div class="card__background">
          <img class="card__image" src="./images/icon-work.svg" alt="work-ico">          
        </div>
</div>        
```

```css
.card {
  ...
}
.card__background {
  ...
}
.card__image{
  ...
}
```
